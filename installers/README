This is a port of tlslite-0.3.8 (http://trevp.net/tlslite/), which is no longer
active developed by its author, Trevor Perrin.

Since RPyC integrates with tlslite for TLS support, the project has been ported
for newer versions of Python (namely, 2.6 and 2.7). You can find the modified 
versions here, as well as the original distribution by Trevor (the file
named tlslite-0.3.8-py2.2-2.5 -- mirrored in case of unavailability of his site)

Python 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 -- Use tlslite-0.3.8-py2.2-2.5. Windows installers
are provided for Python 2.3 and 2.4 (taken from the original distribution by
Trevor).

Python 2.6 and 2.7 can use the other distributions provided on this site, which
include source distributions and Windows installers for Python 2.6 and 2.7.
I don't have Visual Studio 2003, so I can't build the binaries for Python 2.5, 
sorry.
